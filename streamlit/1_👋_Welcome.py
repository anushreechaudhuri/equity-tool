    with st.expander("What is the Justice40 Initiative? What is the National Housing Preservation Database?"):
        st.markdown("The Justice40 Initiative is a cross-agency federal commitment to direct at least 40% of Federal investments in areas like clean energy and energy efficiency; clean transit; affordable and sustainable housing; training and workforce development; the remediation and reduction of legacy pollution; and the development of clean water infrastructure to Disadvantaged Communities (DACs). The Initiative stems from President Biden‚Äôs Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad. The Equitable Building Decarbonization Challenge is a Justice40 covered program and is committed to ensuring equitable investment and access to building electrification.")
        st.markdown("The National Housing Preservation Database (NHPD) is an address-level inventory of federally assisted rental housing in the U.S. The data originates from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and it includes ten federally subsidized programs as well as state and local subsidies from Connecticut, Florida, and Massachusetts. The NHPD was created by the Public and Affordable Housing Research Corporation (PAHRC) and the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) in 2011 to provide communities with the information they need to effectively preserve their stock of public and affordable housing.")
    with st.expander("What is a census tract?"):
        st.markdown("The census tract is the smallest unit of geography for which consistent data can be displayed on the map. The tool uses census tracts that can vary widely in area but represent about 4,000 people each.")
    with st.expander("What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúDisadvantaged‚Äù census tract?"):
        st.markdown("The Department of Energy‚Äôs working definition of ‚ÄúDisadvantaged‚Äù is based on cumulative burden and includes data for thirty six (36) burden indicators collected at the census tract level. These burden indicators can be grouped across the following four categories (the numbers in parenthesis are the number of indicators in each category):")

        st.markdown("* Fossil Dependence (2)")
        st.markdown("* Energy Burden (5)")
        st.markdown("* Environmental and Climate Hazards (10)")
        st.markdown("* Socio-economic Vulnerabilities (19)")
        st.markdown("The 36 burden indicators were selected based on extensive stakeholder outreach, consultation of similar energy justice programs, and recommendations from the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council. To be considered ‚ÄúDisadvantaged‚Äù, a census tract must rank in the 80th percentile of the cumulative sum of the 36 burden indicators and have at least 30% of households classified as low-income. **Nationwide, 13,581 census tracts were identified as DACs using this methodology (18.6% of 73,056 total U.S. census tracts). Additionally, federally recognized tribal lands and U.S. territories, in their entirety, are categorized as ‚ÄúDisadvantaged.‚Äù**")
    with st.expander("What does it mean to be ‚ÄúEligible‚Äù for the Housing Tax Credit?"):
        st.markdown("Census tracts that are identified as ‚ÄúEligible‚Äù for the Housing Tax Credit, also known as ‚ÄúLow-Income Housing Tax Credit Qualified Census Tracts,‚Äù must have 50 percent of households with incomes below 60 percent of the Area Median Gross Income (AMGI) or have a poverty rate of 25 percent or more. This is a general indicator of geographic areas with *naturally occuring* affordable housing and historically low-to-moderate income populations. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) uses the definition of a ‚ÄúQualified Census Tract‚Äù to prioritize subsidies for affordable housing projects in the identified areas.")
    with st.expander("What is Energy Burden?"):
        st.markdown("Energy Burden is a simple ratio based on average annual housing energy costs divided by the average annual household income. So if two census tracts have the *same* annual housing income but one area has *higher* annual housing energy costs, then that area will have a *higher* energy burden. The measure is sourced from the Department of Energy‚Äôs Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) Tool, which draws on the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey 2018 Public Use Microdata Samples.")
    with st.expander("Why are Energy Burden and other indicators reported as percentiles?"):
        st.markdown("The tool ranks each census tract using percentiles that show how much burden each tract experiences relative to all other tracts in the nation, for each indicator. For example, if a tract has a 60% Energy Burden percentile, then 60% of the nation‚Äôs census tracts have *less* Energy Burden and 40% of the nation‚Äôs census tracts have *more* Energy Burden.")
    with st.expander("What do the other indicators in the tool represent?"):
        st.markdown("There will be a table here.")
    with st.expander("What about U.S. Tribal Lands and Territories?"):
        st.markdown("Federally recognized tribal lands and U.S. territories, in their entirety, are categorized as Disadvantaged in accordance with White House Office of Management Budget's Interim Guidance ‚Äúcommon conditions‚Äù definition of community. Tribal lands are defined from census boundaries for American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian lands (U.S. Census Bureau, 2021). U.S. territories include Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, Virgin Islands, and Northern Marianas (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). The tool covers all U.S. census tracts, including those located within Tribal Nations, to the extent that data is available.")
    with st.expander("There‚Äôs not enough data near where I live. What should I do?"):
        st.markdown("This tool is meant to serve as a general guideline and resource, but is not intended to screen out any communities from participating in building decarbonization. Whether or not there is adequate data for your region, you should always rely on your local context and lived experience to determine how to incorporate equity into your decarbonization proposal. While this tool can help narrow down geographic areas of focus, your application will be considered holistically across many different factors.")
